    "\n",
    "The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a crucial organization in the United States that supports and promotes small enterprises by providing access to credit. Through loan guarantees, the SBA encourages lenders to provide credit to small businesses, which play a vital role in job creation and reducing unemployment. However, there have been instances of loan defaults, posing a challenge for the SBA in accurately assessing the creditworthiness of applicants and mitigating risks. To address this, the SBA focuses on evaluating creditworthiness by considering factors such as financial history, business plans, collateral, and projected cash flows. They also strive to adapt to market dynamics, embracing innovative approaches and technology for informed lending decisions that minimize the likelihood of defaults. Overall, the SBA's commitment to supporting small businesses goes beyond loan guarantees, encompassing mentorship programs, training resources, government contracting opportunities, and disaster recovery assistance to foster an environment conducive to small business success.\n",

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the enhanced predictive capabilities of the SBA have revolutionized the loan application process, enabling automated filtration and empowering clients to identify crucial factors influencing their loan eligibility. This advancement not only streamlines the lending process but also fosters a supportive environment for entrepreneurs and small businesses. By encouraging more individuals to seek SBA support, this initiative contributes to reducing unemployment rates and fostering economic growth through increased business opportunities and job creation."

    "## <b> Recommendations </b>\n",
    "Based on the analysis that we have done, we came up with five main areas in which the SBA can dive deeper into, these areas included:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Loan Term </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBA should consider advising the small businesses on the appropriate loan amount to apply for based on the loan amount and term distribution. This can be achieved by identifying the most common loan sizes and advising small businesses to apply for loans within those ranges. Additionally, we recommend that the SBA identifies the most common loan terms and set loan term limits or eligibility criteria based on those terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Size of the Business </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise the SBA to look into the loan amount ranges and/or eligibility criteria for businesses of different sizes based on the employee distribution. Through this, we recommend that they set loan amount limits that would be appropriate for different business sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Location </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We would recommend the SBA to advise the small businesses to seek loans that are appropriate for their location and the needs of their local community. Additionally, the SBA should ensure the distribution of loans is easily accessible to those in the Rural/Semi-urban regions, in order to encourage development\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Business Existence Period </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering whether the business has been in existence for a long or short period of time, we recommend that the SBA advises the businesses seeking loans to apply for loans that are in alignment with their growth plans, additionally, the SBA can recommend and/or implement new training and mentorship programs to help the businesses achieve their targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. Industry </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would suggest that the SBA advises their members to apply for loans that are  tailored to the specific needs of their industry. "
